## Overview
Housing price prediction is a regression task where the goal is to estimate the price of a house based on its characteristics. This project leverages the **XGBoost** algorithm due to its performance and flexibility in handling structured data.

### Key Steps
- Data preprocessing and cleaning
- Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
- Feature engineering and selection
- Model training and hyperparameter optimization
- Cross-validation for robustness
- Final predictions and evaluation

## Features
The project includes the following:
- Feature selection based on correlation analysis
- Training and validation dataset split
- Implementation of XGBoost with tuned hyperparameters
- Cross-validation for better generalization
- Saving predictions to a CSV file

## Setup and Usage
1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/UwaisMansuri22/house-price-prediction-Rcode.git
   cd house-price-prediction-Rcode
